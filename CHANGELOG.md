- **Implemented thumbnail generation** for faster grid display performance
- **Created fallback system** to localStorage if IndexedDB fails

### Image Processing Enhancements

- **Thumbnail optimization**: 150px square thumbnails for grid views reduce memory usage
- **Progress logging**: Console feedback for compression ratios and storage success
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages

### Migration System
- **Automatic migration** from old localStorage images to new IndexedDB system

- **Cleanup process** removes old localStorage data after successful migration

### Technical Improvements
- **Asynchronous processing** for better performance with large images
- **Storage utilities** in separate modules for better code organization
- **Enhanced error handling** with detailed logging and user feedback
- **Fixed save functionality** by updating canvas access method for gl-react-dom

### User Experience
- **Large file support**: No more failed uploads for high-resolution images
- **Faster loading**: Thumbnails improve grid performance and reduce memory usage
- **Persistent storage**: Images now reliably persist between browser sessions
- **Seamless upgrade**: Existing users automatically benefit from improved storage

This update solves the core issue where large images wouldn't persist between page loads, transforming the app into a reliable tool for working with high-resolution artwork.
